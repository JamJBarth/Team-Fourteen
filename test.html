            <div class="headTitle">High Commanding Officers (Warrant Officer+)</div>
            <p>As a soldier of the San Andreas Army, whenever you wish to approach any High Commanding Staff, you will have to properly salute the Commanding Officer before you state your needs and requirements. Additionally, whenever a High Command Officer arrives in a location, you MUST relay the proper Military salute. The default salute for the SANG is ((/ghands 10.))</p>

                Reassembly Location & Policy
            </div>
            <p>During your service time in San Andreas Army, you will hear the word 'Reassemble', which basically means: All soldiers MUST return to base (10-1), replenish their HP & AR, then lineup in front of the Memorial Site (outside by the lockers), and await further commands.

                The soldiers will line in a proper, column formation and await the High Commanding Officer to arrive on-scene. The formation will be as shown:</p>
            <div class="headTitle">Column Formation:-</div>
            <p>Mostly used during the platoon's reassembly.</p>
            <div class="headTitle">File Formation:-</div>
            <p>In narrow areas, the Commanding Officer might order you to form a Single File Formation, which allows the troops to fit into that narrow place while still maintaining their security measures.</p>
            <div class="headTitle">Line Formation:-</div>
            <p>In Open-Areas, the Commanding Officer might order you to form a Line Formation, which covers almost the entire open-area. This formation can also be used in open-area turfs.</p>

        <section class="secThree">
            <div class="headTitle" style="text-align:center">Base Defense Strategy</div><br>
            <p style="text-align:center;">Base defense should be governed by considering the factors of mission, enemy, terrain, weather, troops, support and time available (including all friendly forces). Additionally, careful consideration should be given to the protection of any key strategic or operational assets located in the base.

                The current base commander (Highest H.R available) must evaluate the current threat and determine its level. </p>
            <div class="headTitle">Level I Threats</div>
            <p style="text-align:left">Includes any indirect, unharmful threat (No firearms suspected or holstered firearms) to the Fort's surroundings, Area of operation, and/or troops within. Any breaches through any of the Fort's entrances and/or grounds will be treated as follows:

                Class A Act: A Class-A Act includes a First-Degree warning to be transmitted to the intruder(s), giving them sufficient time to leave the Fort's premises (with an escort). At this stage, troops should have their weapons out with the safety pin [ON]. 
                
                Class B Act: A Class-B Act includes a Second-Degree warning to be transmitted to the intruder(s). At this stage, troops should fire a warning shot nearby, with additional units en-routing to the scene of breach. 
                
                At this level, no vehicles of any sort should be operated, apart from the MP's Gate Patriot.</p>
            <div class="headTitle">Level II Threats</div>
            <p style="text-align:left">Includes any direct (Holstered Firearms suspected) threats to the Fort's surroundings, Area of operation and/or troops within. Any breaches through any of the Fort's entrances and/or grounds will be treated as follows:

                Class A Act: A Class-A Act includes a First-Degree warning to be transmitted to the intruder(s). At this stage, troops should fire a warning shot nearby, with additional units en-routing to the scene of breach. The intruder(s) must carefully be extracted from the scene to the exterior of the base.
                
                Class B Act: A Class-B Act includes the authorization of 'Shoot-to-Kill' policy. At this stage, troops are allowed to fire injuring and/or lethal shots to the intruder(s), depending on the severity of the threat at hand. Troops are advised to minimize the usage of lethal power as much as possible, to avoid combat and life losses.
                
                At this level, troops should operate the following vehicles:-
                - A Hunter should patrol the AO for any further breaches
                - An X amount of Patriot(s) should patrol the interior and exterior of the Fort for any further breaches
                - An X amount of troop(s) should operate and function the Guard Towers with direct firing power.
                - An X amount of troop(s) should approach and handle the breach at-hand.
                </p>
            <div class="headTitle">Level III Threats</div>
            <p style="text-align:left">Includes any direct threats to the Fort's surroundings, Area of operation, and/or troops within. Any breaches through any of the Fort's entrances and/or grounds will be treated as follows:

                Class A Act: A Class-A Act includes full authorization of 'Shoot-to-Kill' policy. At this stage, troops have the full authorization to use lethal rounds at any intruder(s) within the Fort's grounds. 
                
                At this level, troops should quickly operate the following vehicles:-
                - An X amount of Hunter(s) should patrol the AO for any further breaches
                - An X amount of Patriot(s) should patrol the interior and exterior of the Fort for any further breaches
                - An X amount of troop(s) should operate and function the Guard Towers with direct firing power.
                
                Depending on the severity of the threat, tanks may or may not be used. This decision is left for the base commander to decide based on the threat's level.</p>
            <div class="headTitle" style="text-align:center;">If any person(s) fails to abide by the instructions given to them by the Military Police Personnel, then troops have the right to open fire and shoot-to-kill, under Section 22-40503.01 of L.S law, which allows Military Troops to use lethal force against any civilian, LEO and/or emergency unit that failed to follow instructions within Military grounds.
